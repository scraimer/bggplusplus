BGG++
=====

[BoardGameGeek.com][bgg] is a great website, and since I spend so much time there, I thoguht I should tweak some things that I felt were missing.

Note: Each of the tweaks below is configurable, so you can disable each one you don't use.

Boardgame Search Results
------------------------
* When there's only once search result, why bother even looking at the results page? So it opens that single item automatically.

* I like looking for games by "play time" or "number of players". So I made it so that the search results show that, and the default columns.

Browsing New Subscribed Items
-----------------------------

I have a lot of subscriptions that are geeklists and as such, the updates to them are scattered about the page. I got tired looking for "red borders", so I added a couple of buttons in the upper-right corner that let you jump among them.

Installation
============

You can install it from the Google Chrome webstore at
